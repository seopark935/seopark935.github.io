**Developed Technical Skills:**
- **Django Proficiency**: Built a full-stack web app with Django 5, implementing models, views, templates, authentication, and CRUD features.
- **Website Organization**: Structured the project into reusable apps, templates, and models while ensuring a clean layout.
- **Cloud Deployment**: Deployed the app to PythonAnywhere, configuring settings, static files, and utilizing a virtual Python environment.

For this project, I built a movie store web application using Django 5, following the textbook Django 5 for the Impatient by Daniel Correa and Greg Lim. The application provides the framework for a functional e-commerce system where users can browse movies, manage a shopping cart, write reviews, and track orders.

The backend uses a SQLite database to store user accounts, movie data, shopping carts, reviews, and order details. The website fulfills a wide range of user stories, including account registration, login/logout, movie search, shopping cart management, order history, and review creation/editing/deletion. Administrators also have full CRUD functionality to manage users, movies, and reviews.

One of the biggest challenges I encountered was debugging/reformatting Django template code and handling formatting issues to make sure the UI displayed correctly. Another challenge was deploying the app to PythonAnywhere, which required reconfiguring the project for a production environment. When facing these challenges (usually through differences in how the website looked at each step), I honed my debugging skills by identifying where the errors were occuring. Furthermore, I gained soft skills in understanding the relationships between user stories and feature development by working through each chapter carefully, focusing on the purpose behind each implementation.

Ultimately, it was a great experience to get used to Django and website development, and I hope to work on similar projects in the future, although I would prefer a little less hand-holding.
