**Developed Technical Skills:**
- **Prototyping and Materials Selection**: Built a functional prototype using flotation devices, reflective mylar, and plastic supports.
- **Mechanical Design**: Developed a flexible support system with retractable lanyards to adjust to wave movements.
- **Experimental Testing**: Conducted temperature reduction tests on surrounding water after creating a prototype.

I began this project in the first semester of my sophomore year (Fall 2022), aiming to develop an affordable, modular solution to reduce iceberg melt. The concept involved deploying reflective flotation devices around icebergs to prevent heat absorption. By reflecting sunlight away from the water surface, the devices could theoretically reduce melting caused by heat absorption in the darker ocean water exposed by melting ice.

For the prototype, I used a bodyboard as the flotation base, supported by mylar sheets attached to plastic struts. Retractable lanyards connected the components, allowing flexibility to adapt to ocean waves. 

After constructing the prototype, I tested its effectiveness in reducing surrounding water temperature over time and observed a small decrease, indicating some potential for reducing temperature increase.
