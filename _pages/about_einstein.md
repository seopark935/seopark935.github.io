Hello, and welcome to my project portfolio! My name is Seohyun Park, and I am a passionate first-year Computer Engineering major at Georgia Tech interested in chip design, bioinformatics, and embedded systems.

I currently work as a computational drug discovery researcher in the [Liang Lab](https://med.emory.edu/departments/biochemistry/research-labs/liang/index.html) at Emory University, where I was a co-lead author on a published paper (see the Publications tab for details). Additionally, I am a junior app developer on the Loop subteam of Georgia Tech's [iOS development club](https://gtios.club/) and am gaining experience in physical design as part of the Decode block under the Physical Design subteam in Georgia Tech's [SiliconJackets club](https://siliconjackets.gt/).

This site highlights key projects and accomplishments, demonstrating my technical skills and problem-solving abilities across diverse programming languages.
