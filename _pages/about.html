My name is Seohyun Park, and I am a Computer Engineering major at Georgia Tech (Graduating May 2027) with threads in <a href="https://ece.gatech.edu/computing-hardware-emerging-architectures-thread">Computer Hardware &amp; Emerging Architectures</a> and <a href="https://www.cc.gatech.edu/academics/threads/systems-architecture">Systems &amp; Architecture</a>, interested in chip design, bioinformatics, and embedded systems.</p> <p>I currently work as a computational drug discovery researcher in the <a href="https://med.emory.edu/departments/biochemistry/research-labs/liang/index.html">Liang Lab</a> at Emory University, where I was a co-lead author on a published paper (see the Publications tab for details). Additionally, I am a junior app developer on the Loop subteam of Georgia Tech’s <a href="https://gtios.club/">iOS development club</a> and am gaining experience in physical design as part of the Decode block under the Physical Design subteam in Georgia Tech’s <a href="https://siliconjackets.gt/">SiliconJackets club</a>.</p> <p>This site highlights key projects and accomplishments, demonstrating my technical skills and problem-solving abilities across diverse programming languages.</p>
